<h2>1. Project Introduction and Background</h2>
<h3>1.1 Background</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies have evolved from a niche digital
asset into a mainstream asset with high attention and significant
influence in the global financial market. Different from the traditional
financial assets like stocks and bonds, cryptocurrency’s prices do not
depend on actual cash flows or other fundamental information about the
assets themselves; their price volatility is largely influenced by
market sentiment, market attention, and investor expectations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buehlmaier.github.io/MFIN7036-student-blog-2025-12/images/GPT_Chatters_01_price_volatility.png"></p>
<h3>1.2 Intuition of The Relationship Between Market Sentiment and The Price Volatility of Cryptocurrency：</h3>
<p>Intuitively, negative market sentiment, such as panic selling, hacker
attacks, and declining market expectations, tends to result in higher
price volatility. In addition, positive sentiment, such as market
superheating, the introduction of favorable policies, and the growth of
market expectations, can also lead to excessive speculation by
investors, which results in significant price fluctuations. Obviously,
both types of market sentiment contribute to the increase in price
volatility of cryptocurrency; however, the exact impact of these two
sentiments on volatility in the real market remains unclear and
inconsistent.</p>
<h3>1.3 Importance in Finance:</h3>
<p>In the financial field, research on this issue is very important. To
begin with, it helps us have a deeper and more comprehensive
understanding of the irrational behavior and risk formation mechanisms
in the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, for risk management, volatility
prediction, and trading strategy design, distinguishing the influence
strength of different sentiment types can effectively enhance the
interpretability and practical performance of models, and even improve
the returns of trading strategies to some extent. Last but not least,
from a broader perspective, this research also provides a highly
emotionally sensitive and rapidly responsive research environment for
exploring the relationship between market sentiment and market
volatility.</p>
<h3>1.4 Project Overview and Research Objectives:</h3>
<p>In the current cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin accounts for approximately
58.4% of the market share, making it the most critical asset in this
market, which significantly influences the overall market trend. Because
Bitcoin significantly outperforms other cryptocurrencies in terms of
market capitalization, liquidity, and market attention, its price
volatility often serves as a clear market indicator. When market
sentiment shifts, Bitcoin is typically the first to reflect the change
in investors’ risk appetite and then has spillover effects on other
cryptocurrencies. Therefore, our project will focus on Bitcoin, using
natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics to quantify the
positive and negative sentiment in the texts about Bitcoin in news or
social media, and using statistical methods to systematically analyze
their impact on Bitcoin volatility and the relative strength of that
impact.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buehlmaier.github.io/MFIN7036-student-blog-2025-12/images/GPT_Chatters_01_btc_info.png"></p>
<h2>2. Methodology</h2>
<h3>2.1 Data Source and Data Collection</h3>
<h4>2.1.1 Bitcoin News</h4>
<h5>a. CryptoPanic:</h5>
<p>The primary source of cryptocurrency news data will be CryptoPanic, a
news aggregator that redistributes headlines and short summaries from
major crypto media outlets such as CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, and Decrypt.
CryptoPanic provides an official and documented API, making it a stable
and reproducible data source for academic research.</p>
<p>The project will collect Bitcoin-related news headlines and summaries at
the daily frequency. Articles will be filtered using the keyword Bitcoin
to ensure topical relevance. Compared with full article texts, headlines
and summaries are expected to capture the most salient information while
reducing noise and simplifying daily sentiment aggregation.</p>
<h5>b. Hugging Face:</h5>
<p>An open-source dataset available at
<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/edaschau/bitcoin_news/tree/main">https://huggingface.co/datasets/edaschau/bitcoin_news/tree/main</a>. This
dataset provides historical Bitcoin-related news articles, which can be
downloaded and integrated using the Hugging Face Datasets library in
Python. It offers a diverse collection of articles from various outlets,
allowing for broader coverage.</p>
<h5>c.NewsData.io:</h5>
<p>NewsData.io provides a real-time and historical news API focused on
specific topics like Bitcoin. It offers structured JSON responses with
headlines, summaries, and full articles from multiple sources. Access
requires an API key, and data can be queried by keywords such as
“Bitcoin” with date filters for daily aggregation.</p>
<h5>d.Google News:</h5>
<p>Google News serves as an additional aggregator for Bitcoin-related
articles, accessible via its RSS feeds or the Google News API. It
aggregates content from a wide range of global sources, providing
headlines, summaries, and links to full articles. Data can be filtered
by topic “Bitcoin” and date ranges for daily collection, enhancing
diversity in perspectives.</p>
<h4>2.1.2 Social Media</h4>
<p>To complement professional news sentiment, the project will primarily
use Reddit comment data from cryptocurrency-related subreddits such as
r/Bitcoin. Reddit provides an official API, which can be accessed using
the Python library PRAW. However, due to potential rate limits, access
restrictions, and high noise levels, Reddit data will be treated as a
core secondary source.</p>
<p>For further supplementation and to capture real-time public discourse,
the project will consider incorporating Twitter data in subsequent
phases. Twitter data can be accessed via the Twitter API (v2) or
libraries like Tweepy, focusing on Bitcoin-related tweets and replies.
This will provide a broader social sentiment perspective, especially for
trending topics. Similar to Reddit, rate limits and noise will be
managed through targeted queries.</p>
<h4>2.1.3 Financial Data</h4>
<p>Daily Bitcoin price data will be obtained from Yahoo Finance using the
ticker BTC-USD, which provides consistent and publicly accessible
historical price series. The analysis will rely on daily closing prices.</p>
<p>To mitigate reverse causality, sentiment indicators constructed from
textual data will be lagged by one day when analyzed against volatility
measures.</p>
<p>To support the construction of investment strategies, the project will
incorporate the Bitcoin DVOL Index (Deribit Volatility Index), which
measures implied volatility for Bitcoin options. This index reflects
market expectations of future price swings and can inform long-short
strategies (e.g., going long on low-volatility periods or short on
high-volatility signals). DVOL data can be fetched from the Deribit
public API, providing historical volatility readings.</p>
<h3>2.2 Model Variables</h3>
<h4>2.2.1 Model Inputs</h4>
<p>The input variables are daily measures of positive and negative
sentiment derived from textual data. News articles related to Bitcoin
are collected via APIs and web-based sources (e.g., CryptoPanic, which
aggregates content from major crypto media). For each article, sentiment
scores are computed using NLP-based sentiment models. These
article-level scores are then aggregated across all Bitcoin-related news
published on day (<em>t</em>−1) to obtain daily sentiment indicators.</p>
<p>Using lagged sentiment variables allows the model to capture how
previously available information is associated with subsequent market
dynamics, while mitigating concerns about reverse causality between
price movements and news tone.</p>
<p>In addition to single-day sentiment measures, the model design also
considers rolling-window sentiment inputs, such as multi-day averages of
sentiment scores. The specific window length (e.g., 3-day or 7-day) is
not fixed a priori and will be determined based on empirical performance
during the experimental stage.</p>
<h4>2.2.2 Model Output and Volatility Measurement</h4>
<p>The output variable is Bitcoin market volatility on day (<em>t</em>),
constructed from daily price data. Let (( P_t )) denote the
daily closing price of Bitcoin. Daily log returns are computed as:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buehlmaier.github.io/MFIN7036-student-blog-2025-12/images/GPT_Chatters_01_F1.png"></p>
<p>Market volatility is proxied using standard return-based measures:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buehlmaier.github.io/MFIN7036-student-blog-2025-12/images/GPT_Chatters_01_F2.png"></p>
<p>These measures capture the magnitude of daily price movements regardless
of direction and are widely adopted in empirical finance as simple and
effective proxies for realized volatility at the daily frequency.</p>
<h4>2.2.3 Sentiment Modeling Considerations</h4>
<p>The construction of sentiment scores from textual data is a key
component of this study. At the initial stage, the project plans to
employ lexicon-based sentiment models, such as VADER and FinBERT, due to
their ease of implementation, computational efficiency, and widespread
use in financial text analysis. These models allow for rapid sentiment
scoring of large volumes of news text.</p>
<p>However, lexicon-based approaches may suffer from context insensitivity,
particularly in cryptocurrency-related news where technical terminology
or neutral wording may still convey strong market implications. As a
result, sentiment scores obtained from these methods may contain
measurement noise.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, more advanced approaches are considered.
One option is to apply machine learning–based sentiment classification
models, which may better capture complex semantic patterns but typically
require large, labeled training datasets that may not be readily
available in the cryptocurrency domain. Alternatively, the project
considers adopting sentiment scoring methodologies proposed in existing
academic literature, where validated models have been applied to
financial or crypto-related texts. If necessary, large language model
(LLM)–based sentiment scoring may be explored as a supplementary
approach, particularly for robustness checks or qualitative validation.</p>
<h3>2.3 Model Construction</h3>
<h4>2.3.1 Linear Regression Model</h4>
<p>As the foundation for forecasting, Linear models are widely used in
empirical finance due to their interpretability, simplicity, and ease of
hypothesis testing. In our analysis, we employed linear regression
models as our baseline approach to quantify the relationship between the
sentiment scores derived from the text corpora of news and Bitcoin’s
price volatility. Specifically, we constructed a series of ordinary
least squares (OLS) regressions of the form:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buehlmaier.github.io/MFIN7036-student-blog-2025-12/images/GPT_Chatters_01_F3.png"></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ol>
<li>"V" is a realized volatility measure on day t,</li>
<li>"Positive Sentiment" are the positive sentiment scores derived from news within sliding windows</li>
<li>"Negative Sentiment" are the negative sentiment scores derived from news within sliding windows.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2.3.2 Machine Learning Models</h4>
<p>Based on previous researches, it was highly likely that the relationship
between sentiment scores and price volatility is non-linear. In response
to this situation, we also explored a wide range of machine learning
models beyond the classical linear regression model. The machine
learning models we investigated included Random Forest, XGBoost and
LightGBM.</p>
<h5>a. Random Forest:</h5>
<p>Random Forest is an ensemble tree-based model that builds many decision
trees, lets them work simultaneously, making their own decisions and
uses majority voting to determine the final prediction, rendering it to
become robust to messy noises. In the context of Bitcoin sentiment
analysis, it can automatically capture non-linear effects between
multiple sentiment indicators and market variables without extensive
feature engineering. Its stability and resistance to overfitting make it
a strong non-parametric baseline for volatility forecasting when linear
assumptions are insufficient.</p>
<h5>b. XGBoost:</h5>
<p>XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting framework that builds trees
sequentially, where each subsequent tree corrects the errors of previous
ones. This learning strategy enables the model to capture the intricate
patterns and subtle non-linear dependencies in financial time series.
These characteristics often allow the model to achieve superior
predictive performances compared to simpler ensembles. Its built-in
regularization and flexibility make it particularly suited for modeling
the nuanced relationship between sentiment scores and future Bitcoin
volatility.</p>
<h5>c. LightGBM:</h5>
<p>LightGBM is an optimized gradient boosting model designed for efficiency
and scalability on large datasets, using a leaf-wise tree growth
strategy and histogram-based splitting. It is especially appropriate
when iterating over many hyperparameter configurations or when working
with extensive news-derived feature sets that would be computationally
heavy for other boosting implementations. Using a large dataset with
more than 100k lines of items, LightGBM becomes favorably suitable for
our research and is currently presumed to be our top choice among these
machine learning models. It efficiently offers faster training and lower
memory consumption while still capturing complex feature interactions.</p>
<h3>2.4 Model Summarization</h3>
<p>In our methodology design, we developed a sentiment-driven framework to
forecast Bitcoin price volatility by systematically transforming
unstructured news text into predictive signals. We systematically
collected Bitcoin-related news from multiple sources and applied
NLP-based sentiment analysis models to construct daily aggregated
positive and negative sentiment scores. Using these lagged sentiment
measures, we adopted a two-stage modeling strategy. First, we employed
linear regressions as a benchmark to test economic intuition and
directional effects. However, due to the limitations of linear
assumptions, we extended our analysis to non-linear machine learning
models as well — including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM — to
capture complex interactions and nonlinear dependencies between
sentiment and market dynamics. Finally, we evaluated the performances
for all our models through out-of-sample forecasts, assessed their
consistencies between predicted and actual volatility, and eventually
selected the model with the strongest predictive power as our proposed
model.</p>
<h2>3. Problems and Challenges</h2>
<p>Using news and social media sentiment to predict Bitcoin volatility
sounds intuitive, but it comes with real challenges. Not all posts
matter equally: a viral tweet from a well-known account can move
markets, while most comments add little signal. Aggregating everything
the same way often introduces noise rather than insight. Timing is
another issue. Sentiment is usually measured daily, even though news and
social media react in real time, which can blur short-lived market
reactions. On the modeling side, Bitcoin volatility is highly unstable,
with sudden regime shifts and extreme movements that simple or static
models struggle to handle. Relying on sentiment alone also ignores
valuable information from prices, volume, and market structure. Finally,
it’s hard to tell cause from effect—markets influence news just as much
as news influences markets.</p>
<h2>4. Future Research Directions</h2>
<p>Future work can improve on these limitations in several ways. Sentiment
measures could weight posts by influence, engagement, or relevance to
major events instead of treating all content equally. Using intraday or
mixed-frequency data may better match how information actually reaches
markets. Combining sentiment with technical indicators like volatility,
volume, or momentum can also lead to more stable predictions. On the
modeling side, sequence-based approaches such as LSTMs or Transformers
can capture how sentiment and volatility evolve over time, while
attention mechanisms help identify which news really matters. Finally,
testing models across different market regimes and using more robust
tuning strategies can make results more reliable and easier to trust.</p>
